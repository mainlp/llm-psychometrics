Some features that distinguish informational text from literary text are organization and the way information is presented.  Informational text is organized by topic and supporting details, whereas literary text is organized by the structure of a story, poem, or drama.  Informational texts may have boldface headings, graphics, illustrations, and captions that signal importance in the text.  However, some commonalities exist between literary and informational text and the skills and strategies required for reading each.  Both require people to critically analyze the text, reflect on it, and draw conclusions.<p/>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reading for information, readers need to know the specific text patterns, or forms of organization (e.g., cause and effect, sequential order, comparison/contrast, opinion and supporting arguments), to develop understanding.  People frequently have different purposes for reading text of this natureâ€”for example, to find specific pieces of information, answer a question, or get some general information when glancing through a magazine article.  Reading informational text calls for orientations to the text that differ from those used in reading for literary experience because readers are specifically focused on acquiring information.  When people read for information, they may select parts of the text they need, rather than reading from beginning to end.","hasChildren":false,"isSelected":false,"framework":2,"hasParent":true,"ccTableID":"69","sortOrder":2,"nqtFramework":1,"childList":[]},{"maxLength":0,"contentCategoryName":"Reading to Perform a Task","contentCategoryContent":"<ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<li>Involves reading in order to accomplish or do something</li>\\r\\n\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people read to perform tasks, they use their expectations of the purpose and structure of practical text to guide how they select, understand, and apply information.  Practical text may include charts, bus or train schedules, directions for games or repairs, classroom or library procedures, tax or insurance forms, recipes, voter registration materials, maps, referenda, consumer warranties, or office memos.  The reader\'s orientation involves looking for specific information to do something.  Readers need to apply information, not simply understand it.
